    <p>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <del>Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's</del>  standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <mark>It has <strong>survived not</strong>  only five centuries, </mark>  but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets <b>containing Lorem </b> Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.</p>
